# 🚀 Deployment Guide – Esensia SIMRS

## 📦 Overview

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)** to the production server `simrs.esensia.co.id`.

Deployment is manually triggered via the **"Actions > Deploy to Production"** menu in GitHub.

## 🌐 Environment

| Environment               | Description                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `dev.esensia.co.id`       | Testing environment for Alfian |
| `simrs.esensia.co.id`     | Main production server          |

---

## ⚙️ Workflow: Deploy to Production

This workflow runs in `workflow_dispatch` mode, which can be manually triggered from GitHub.

### 🔢 Input Parameters

| Input Name | Description |
|------------|-----------|
| `mode`     | Deploy mode. Options: `commit-all`, `commit-sha`, `revert-all`, `revert-sha` |
| `ref`      | Commit SHA or branch name (example: `main` or `e6a1b1d`). Used only if mode is `commit-sha` or `revert-sha` |

---

## 🚦 Mode Explanations

### ✅ `commit-all`
Deploy all latest changes from the `main` branch.

### ✅ `commit-sha`
Deploy based on a specific commit (SHA commit).  
Example: `e6a1b1d`  
📌 Use this if you only want to push a specific commit.

### 🔄 `revert-all`
Revert the last commit on the production server.

### 🔄 `revert-sha`
Checkout back to a specific commit (for manual rollback).  
Example: `e6a1b1d`

------

## 🧪 Suggested Workflow

1. **Developer commits to `main` branch or others**.
2. **Deploy to `dev.esensia.co.id` (automatic)**.
3. **Testing by Alfian**.
4. If testing passes, **run the "Deploy to Production" workflow**:
   - Choose mode `commit-all` or `commit-sha`.
   - Press `Run Workflow`.
